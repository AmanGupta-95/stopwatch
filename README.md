# Stopwatch Coding Challenge By Mayank Gureja 

## 📄 Objective
Build a Stopwatch application using ReactJS. This single-page application should have a central digital clock showing hours, minutes and seconds. 

On page load, the user should see a button to start the stopwatch. The clock should show time ticking up. Once started, the user can pause or reset the clock. 

There must also be a button to record the current elapsed time and save it. The user can save as many times as they like while the stopwatch is running. Display the saved times on the page. The saved times must persist a page refresh.

Feel free to design it however you wish. Slick or unique interfaces are most welcome. Use SASS instead of CSS for styling. You may use any CSS framework, if you wish.

You may use third-party libraries to support any part of this application, if you need it.
